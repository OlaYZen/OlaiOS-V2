# OlaiOS V2
I am excited to announce that I am currently in the process of developing OlaiOS V2, the successor to the original OlaiOS. The original OlaiOS was a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, however, due to technical difficulties and a lack of motivation, development on the original version was discontinued. After much consideration, I have decided to shift the focus and create a custom version of Windows as the foundation for the new operating system.

OlaiOS V2 will be an operating system that is based on Windows, and I have plans to actively maintain and use it as my primary operating system upon completion. This decision was made after much research and consideration, as I believe that a Windows-based operating system has the potential to provide users with a more familiar and user-friendly experience.

I have big plans for OlaiOS V2 and I am confident that it will offer a fresh take on the traditional Windows operating system. I plan to include a wide range of features and improvements such as a custom game mode, enhanced performance, and a sleek, modern user interface. Additionally, I will be applying my experience in developing the original OlaiOS to the new version, ensuring a high level of quality and stability.

With its unique approach and emphasis on user experience, OlaiOS V2 has the potential to attract a large following and become a popular alternative to traditional operating systems. I also plan to make the source code available to the community, encouraging others to contribute and improve the operating system. This will allow for a more collaborative development process and will help to ensure that the operating system is constantly evolving and improving.

As for the release date, I am currently working on finalizing the development of OlaiOS V2, and anticipate a release in 2023. I understand that many are excited to get their hands on the new operating system and I assure you that I am working hard to ensure it meets the high standards I have set for it. I will make sure to keep everyone updated on the progress and will announce the official release date as soon as it becomes available. I am confident that OlaiOS V2 will be worth the wait and will provide users with an exceptional computing experience.

I would also like to mention that the source code for OlaiOS V2 will be available to the public through a repository upon release. This will allow others to contribute to the development of the operating system and improve it even further. However, during the development phase, the code will be kept in a private repository to ensure the stability and security of the operating system before its official release. But once the operating system is released, the code will be open for anyone to use, modify and distribute as per the Open source license agreement. I look forward to the community's involvement in the development of OlaiOS V2 and I believe that this will help to make it an even more exceptional operating system.

In conclusion, OlaiOS V2 promises to be an exciting and innovative addition to the world of operating systems. With its focus on user experience, enhanced performance, and a wide range of features and improvements, I am confident that it will be a popular alternative to traditional operating systems. I look forward to its official release and to the community's involvement in its development. Thank you for your interest in OlaiOS V2, and stay tuned for further updates.
