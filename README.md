# OlaiOS V2
OlaiOS V2 is the successor to the original OlaiOS, which was a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux. However, due to technical difficulties and a lack of motivation, development on the original version was discontinued. In recent years, the decision was made to shift the focus to creating a custom version of Windows as the foundation for the new operating system. OlaiOS V2 is an operating system that is based on Windows, and I have plans to actively maintain and use it as their primary operating system upon completion.

The future for OlaiOS V2 is promising as it offers a fresh take on the traditional Windows operating system. I have plans to include a wide range of features and improvements, such as a custom gamemode and enhanced performance. Additionally, my experience in developing the original OlaiOS will be applied to the new version, ensuring a high level of quality and stability. With its unique approach and emphasis on user experience, OlaiOS V2 has the potential to attract a large following and become a popular alternative to traditional operating systems. I also plan to make the source code available to the community, encouraging others to contribute and improve the operating system. Overall, OlaiOS V2 promises to be an exciting and innovative addition to the world of operating systems.

As for the release date, I am currently working on finalizing the development of OlaiOS V2, and anticipate a release in 2023. I understand that many are excited to get their hands on the new operating system and I assure you that I am working hard to ensure it meets the high standards I have set for it. I will make sure to keep everyone updated on the progress and will announce the official release date as soon as it becomes available. I am confident that OlaiOS V2 will be worth the wait and will provide users with an exceptional computing experience.
